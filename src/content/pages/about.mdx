# About Me

Hello! I'm **Adol**, a passionate software developer with an insatiable curiosity for science and technology. I started this blog to share my thoughts and what I learn.

## My background

I am a computer scientist and electrical engineer, with years of experience in research, renewable energy and oil and gas (apparently). Currently I own a startup company in AI applied to biotech, and continue my PhD studies in quantum computing applied to electrical energy systems.

## Why am I doing this?

I believe in **learning by doing** and **sharing knowledge**. Hopefully, this will also help others to become passionate about science and tech.

## Let's Connect

I love connecting, whether you're just starting your journey or you're a seasoned professional; feel free to reach out if you want to discuss technology, share ideas, or just say hello!
