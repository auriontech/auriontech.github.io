I have been thinking about writing a blog for a while as a way to communicate better and organize my thoughts.

I don't expect anyone to read this blog, but, for whoever do, I would love that they enjoy and share the passion I have for science and technology.

If during this new little venture I learn about how do I think and whether there is any patterns I want to avoid, I would call that a win :)

Ok, back to work!
